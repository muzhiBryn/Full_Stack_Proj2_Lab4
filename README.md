# Lab4 readme
## An introduction of the functions

I finished this lab and implemented all the functions required. 
### New post
when you click the right above **+** icon, you will be able to create a new post. This can be edited in a markdown format. the **SAVE** button can save the content and get you back to the home page. The **TRASH** icon will not save this post draft and lead you back to the home page too.

### Update Post
click on the post picture or text parts can both lead you to the **update post** page. Here I used the note from LAB3 to make it more clear to operate. when you click the **pencil** icon, you can deit the content in a markdown format. click the **trash** button would delete this post. the **back** icon would save the change and go back to the home page.

## Delete post
if you are going to remove a post. just click that one and enter into the post detail page, there you can find the **trash** icon I had shown you earlier.

## css styling
to make it better fit the size of the display page, I tried with a **navbar** and 3 posts for each row at most.


## Extra credit
No. I didn't do that:))
